        <p>In recent years, smartphones have become a common tool in education, with many schools introducing policies that allow students to use them in the classroom. While traditionally smartphones were seen as distractions, their potential for educational use has led to a shift in how they are viewed. Some schools have begun integrating smartphones into lessons, allowing students to use them for research, communication, and even interactive learning tools. As a result, smartphones are becoming a valuable educational resource in many classrooms.</p>
        
        <p>Supporters claim that smartphones offer a wide range of benefits for students. They argue that smartphones can enhance learning by providing access to vast amounts of information and online resources. Students can use them to conduct research, watch educational videos, and participate in interactive learning apps. Furthermore, smartphones enable easier communication between students and teachers, fostering collaboration and engagement in the classroom.</p>
        
        <p>Despite this, critics are concerned about the negative impact of smartphones in schools. They argue that smartphones can be a significant source of distraction, with students often becoming more focused on social media or games than on the lesson at hand. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for cheating during exams or assignments. In contrast, traditional methods of teaching, such as using textbooks and face-to-face communication, are seen as more effective in maintaining focus and discipline.</p>
